## Feature Breakdown

### User Management
Allows users to create accounts, log in, and manage their profiles. Users can update their personal information, profile pictures, and preferences. This feature ensures secure authentication and provides a personalized experience for each user.

### Property Management
Enables property owners to list, edit, and manage their properties on the platform. Owners can upload photos, set pricing, add descriptions, and manage availability. This feature is essential for attracting guests and maintaining an up-to-date property catalog.

### Booking System
Allows guests to search for properties, view availability, and book accommodations for specific dates. This feature handles the core functionality of the platform by connecting guests with available properties. The booking system calculates prices, manages reservations, and tracks booking status.

### Reviews and Ratings
Enables guests to leave reviews and ratings for properties and hosts after their stay. This feature builds trust within the community by providing authentic feedback and helping future guests make informed decisions. Reviews also help property owners improve their services.

### Payment Processing
Handles secure payment transactions between guests and hosts for bookings. This feature integrates with payment gateways to process credit card payments, transfers, and refunds. It ensures financial security and transparency for both parties.

### Search and Filtering
Allows guests to search for properties based on location, price range, amenities, and other criteria. This feature improves user experience by helping guests quickly find properties that match their needs. Advanced filtering options make the platform more user-friendly and efficient.

### Notifications and Messaging
Enables communication between guests and hosts through notifications and messaging. This feature allows hosts to respond to inquiries, confirm bookings, and communicate with guests. Clear communication helps prevent misunderstandings and improves overall user satisfaction.
## API Security

### Authentication
Authentication verifies that users are who they claim to be by requiring login credentials (username and password). We will implement JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure token-based authentication. This is crucial for protecting user accounts and ensuring only authorized users can access their personal data and bookings.

### Authorization
Authorization determines what authenticated users are allowed to do within the application. We will implement role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure users can only access resources they own or are permitted to access. This prevents unauthorized users from modifying other users' properties, bookings, or payments.

### Data Encryption
All sensitive data, including passwords and payment information, will be encrypted using industry-standard encryption algorithms. Data will be encrypted both in transit (using HTTPS/SSL) and at rest in the database. This protects user privacy and prevents data breaches from exposing sensitive information.

### Rate Limiting
Rate limiting restricts the number of API requests a user or IP address can make within a specific time period. This prevents brute-force attacks, DDoS attacks, and protects the server from being overwhelmed. Rate limiting is essential for maintaining API stability and security.

### Input Validation
All user inputs will be validated on the server side to prevent malicious data from being processed. We will sanitize inputs to prevent SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other injection attacks. Proper input validation ensures data integrity and prevents security vulnerabilities.

### Secure Payment Handling
Payment information will be handled securely using industry-standard payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal). We will never store full credit card details on our servers and will comply with PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard). Secure payment handling protects users' financial information and builds trust in the platform.

### CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
CORS policies will be configured to control which external websites can access our API. This prevents unauthorized cross-origin requests and protects against certain types of attacks. Proper CORS configuration ensures the API is only accessed by trusted applications.

### API Logging and Monitoring
All API requests and responses will be logged and monitored for suspicious activity. We will track authentication attempts, failed requests, and unusual patterns. This helps detect security breaches early and provides an audit trail for compliance and troubleshooting.
## CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?
CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. Continuous Integration (CI) involves automatically testing and integrating code changes from multiple developers into a shared repository. Continuous Deployment (CD) automates the process of deploying tested code to production environments. Together, CI/CD pipelines streamline the development workflow and ensure code quality.

### Why CI/CD is Important for This Project
CI/CD pipelines are crucial for the AirBnB Clone project for several reasons. They automatically run tests on every code change, catching bugs early before they reach production. This reduces the time between development and deployment, allowing the team to release features faster. CI/CD also ensures consistency across deployments and reduces the risk of human error. For a project handling user data and payments, automated testing and deployment provide confidence in code quality and security.

### CI/CD Tools and Technologies

#### GitHub Actions
GitHub Actions is a built-in CI/CD tool that automates workflows directly from your GitHub repository. It can run tests, build applications, and deploy code automatically whenever changes are pushed. GitHub Actions is ideal for this project because it integrates seamlessly with our repository.

#### Docker
Docker is a containerization platform that packages the application and its dependencies into containers. This ensures the application runs consistently across different environments (development, testing, production). Docker simplifies deployment and makes the application more scalable and maintainable.

#### Jest
Jest is a JavaScript testing framework used for unit and integration testing. It helps ensure that individual functions and features work correctly. Running Jest tests in the CI pipeline catches bugs before code is merged.

#### ESLint
ESLint is a code quality tool that analyzes JavaScript code for potential errors and style issues. Integrating ESLint into the CI pipeline ensures code consistency and prevents common programming mistakes across the team.

#### npm/yarn
Package managers like npm and yarn manage project dependencies and can run automated build scripts. They are used in the CI pipeline to install dependencies and build the application before testing and deployment.
